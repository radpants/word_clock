			<h3>Known Issues:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Has some weirdness when combined with the Fliqo screensaver in the system preferences window... it all works, it just doesn't preview the right screesaver.</li>
				<li>The gnomes that write out the time are confused and thing that evening starts after noon... they are sleepy okay!</li>
